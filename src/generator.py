"""
The password generator app.

A small application that allows you to generate a password of any complexity using a user-friendly
graphical interface with accessible settings and save it in a convenient 'txt' file so you don't forget
your social media passwords.

This module contains the core logic for generating password, evaluating their strength,
and it's used by both the CLI and the GUI versions of the application.
